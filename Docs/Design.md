### Tech Stack
Vue.js - React - FireBase

### Output expected
- Firstly, the app should be able to create 2 teams from given input.
- Also, it should have a database of possible team formations for different number of players
- It should also be able to add new players, edit player details
- Visuals:
  - It should be like a game design, where all are visible in formation
  - It should not be cramped, to view a team give drop down

### Ideas
- There may be a rank system where players who play often will be given higher rank (like OVR)
- May be create FIFA card like graphics for players
